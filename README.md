## Development Team
Currently I am ([Michele Aiello](https://micheleaiello.com)) the sole developer of Vaniglia.

I've received some bug fixing from Stefano Antonelli and some modules by Patrizio Munzi, both my colleagues at ERIS4. In the future I hope to get more involvment in this project from other developers.

## Credits

We have to thanks a lot of people who helped us in the development of this set of Java components either with tools, ideas or simply by letting us work on this open source project.
* **JetBrains**. They provided us with an Open Source licence of their excellent Java IDE that is IntelliJ IDEA 5.0. It is my personal favorite IDE for Java Programming. Some time I feel like it is writing the code for me!
 
* **Yourkit Java Profile**. YourKit is kindly supporting open source projects with its full-featured Java Profiler. YourKit, LLC is creator of innovative and intelligent tools for profiling Java and .NET applications. Take a look at YourKit's leading software products: YourKit Java Profiler and YourKit .NET Profiler.
 
* **eris4**. It's my company and they always let me spend a lot of time coding for this project that is also widely used in our products

## Note
This project has concluded in December 2008. Unfortunately the history is lost (I'm trying to recover it) since the export from GoogleCode to Github failed.
