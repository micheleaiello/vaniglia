     - Added module Extension Framework
        This module is intented to be used for simple extension (plugin like) for applications. It allows the
        application developer to define Extension Points that other developers can use to extend the application
        behavior. The Extension configuration file can be modified at runtime and will be reloaded by the
        Extension. Global parameters can be provided and will be subsctituted in all extensions parameters using them.

     - Added module Socket Communication Framework
        This module is intented to be used for simple socket-based communication protocols. It features reconnection,

            restart the parsing from the last parsed record.
        - FixedLenghtRecords and VariableLenghtRecords can have "named" fields.

0.2.2 (07-Oct-2004)

        Averages (or lap) can also maintain their history.

    - Included some classes from jakarta common collections.
        I've prefered to include only some classes from common collections insted of the whole jar because
